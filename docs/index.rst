===============================================

This program generates gene descriptions for `WormBase <http://wormbase.org>`_.

The main program, `generate_descriptions.py <generate_descriptions>`_, combines the functions of three sub-modules to
get the raw data from WormBase and generate the gene descriptions. The following section links to the modules of the
project.
